title: "Comparison to `imate`"
---

Much of `primate`'s computational code was directly ported from the (excellent) [`imate` package](https://github.com/ameli/imate). 
`primate` was developed with slightly different goals in mind than `imate`, most of which have to do with integrability and the choice of FFI / build system. 

Notable differences between the two packages include:  

<!-- - `imate` supports multiple trace estimation approaches, e.g. decompositional methods. `primate` only supports the SLQ method.  
- `imate` supports both CPU parallelism and GPU parallelism. `primate` only supports CPU parallelism.
- `imate` builds [Cython](https://cython.org/) bindings (w/ [setuptools](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html)); `primate` builds [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) bindings (w/ [meson](https://meson-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#))
- `imate`'s uses traditional runtime-linking shared libraries, wheres `primate`'s external API is header-only ([comparison](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12671383/benefits-of-header-only-libraries))
- `imate` works with any standard C++ compiler, whereas `primate` requires (some) compiler support for C++20.
- `imate` is optimized for a fixed set of matrix functions, whereas `primate` allows for arbitrary / user-supplied functions
- `imate` requires matrices as input, whereas `primate` allows arbitrary / user-supplied `LinearOperator`'s   
- `imate` works with any standard C++ compiler, whereas `primate` requires C++20 support. -->

| **Feature**  | `imate` | `primate` |
|---|---|---|
| Trace methods | Multiple  | SLQ only |
| Parallel support | CPU & GPU | CPU only |
| Function support | Fixed | Arbitrary |
| Operator support | Matrix-derived | Arbitrary |
| Linking strategy | Shared libraries | Header only |
| C++ version | Any | $\geq$ C++20 |
| FFI  | Cython | Pybind11 |
| Build tool | CMake | Meson |

The primary motivation for the development of `primate` was to simplify implicit trace estimation for pure C++ operators that lie inside of _external_ (i.e. dependent) Python packages, and to extend support for Python types implementing [SciPys `LinearOperator`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.linalg.LinearOperator.html) abstract interface.

If this fits your use case, consider giving `primate` a try!

<!-- - `imate` might be convenient for Python users that use Cython, whereas `primate` is convenient for C++ users that use pybind11 -->
