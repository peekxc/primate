title: "Installation"
---

`primate` is a standard [PEP-517](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/) package, and thus can be installed via `pip`: 

```python
pip install < primate source directory >
```

Currently the package must be built from source via cloning the repository. PYPI support is planned. 

## Usage with C++ 

`primate`'s core C++ interface is exported as a [header-only library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Header-only), making it easy to compile custom extension modules 
in a separate package against `primate`'s API. 

The simplest way is to do this is to add `primate` as a [dependency to your package](https://peps.python.org/pep-0631/) and use the `get_include()` function to include the header files (this is similar to how [NumPy is exported](https://numpy.org/doc/1.26/reference/generated/numpy.get_include.html)).

For example, with `setuptools`/`distutils`, in `setup.py` you might use:
```python
import primate as pm
...
Extension('extension_name', ..., include_dirs=[pm.get_include()])
...
```

Or, with [meson-python](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson-python), in `meson.build`:

```python
...
primate_include_dirs = run_command(py, 
  ['-c', 'import primate as pm; print(pm.get_include())']
).stdout().strip()
...
```

In general, other methods could be used, e.g. using git submodules (as in [pybind11's installation guide](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing.html#include-as-a-submodule)) or just manually copying over the header files. 
<!-- However, specifying `primate` as a dependency as is preferred, as then the source files are version controlled.   -->

### Integration 

`primate` uses a generic template interface via [C++20 Concepts](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constraints)---thus, and supplying types [fitting the constraints](https://github.com/peekxc/primate/blob/d09459c017fcba68a11eaeb56296ef0c97d6c053/include/_linear_operator/linear_operator.h#L21-L49). This makes it incredibly easy to e.g. add a non-standard matrix function or compile the trace estimator with custom linear operator (todo: document this).
