Whether used for spectral sum estimation, quadrature approximation, or many techniques 
Unfortunately, there are many algorithms named the "stochastic Lanczos quadrature" in the literature, and though each is typically related, they often have introduced and used in different contexts. 

`primate` contains an extensible implementation of the stochastic Lanczos method (SLQ).
