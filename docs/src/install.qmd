title: "Installation"
---

`primate` is a standard [PEP-517](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/) package, and thus can be installed via `pip`: 

```python
pip install < primate source directory >
```

Currently the package must be built from source via cloning the repository. PYPI support is planned.
