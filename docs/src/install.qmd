title: "Installation"
---

`primate` is a standard [PEP-517](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/) package, and thus can be installed via `pip`: 

```python
pip install < primate source directory >
```

Currently the package must be built from source via cloning the repository. PYPI support is planned. 

### Compiling extension modules

`primate`'s C++ interface is [header-only](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Header-only), making it easy to compile your own [extension modules](https://docs.python.org/3/extending/extending.html). The simplest way to link these headers is to add `primate` as a [dependency](https://peps.python.org/pep-0631/) to your package and use the `get_include()` function to find the appropriate directory.

## setuptools 

```python
# setup.py
import primate as pm
...
Extension('extension_name', ..., include_dirs=[pm.get_include()])
...
```

## meson-python

```python
# meson.build
...
primate_include_dirs = run_command(py, 
  ['-c', 'import primate as pm; print(pm.get_include())']
).stdout().strip()
...
```

## git submodule 

Assuming your headers are located in `extern`, from your git repository, you can use: 

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/peekxc/primate extern/primate
git submodule update --init
```

From here, you can now include `extern/primate/include` into your C++ source files, or you can add this directory to the search path used other various build tools, such as [CMake](https://cmake.org/) or [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/).

### Integration 

On the Python side, `primate` uses a supports a variety of matrix-types of the box, including numpy `ndarray`'s, compressed [sparse matrices](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.html) (a lÃ¡ SciPy), and any [LinearOperator](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.linalg.LinearOperator.html). 

In general, `primate` supports _any_ operator posessing the following methods: 

1. A method `A.matvec(input: ndarray) -> ndarray` implementing $v \mapsto Av$
2. A method `A.shape() -> tuple` yielding the matrix dimensions `(A.nrow(), A.ncol())`

This support extends to the C++ side as well---see the [C++ integration guide](integration.qmd). If you're using pybind11 and you want to be able to create your own trace estimator from Python, see the [pybind11 integration guide](pybind11_integration.qmd).
